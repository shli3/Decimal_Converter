# Decimal_Converter

Mini program that allows user to input a value into decimal representation and converts that value to either hexadecimal representation or octal representation.
Program made and copywritten by Steven Shlimoon. Made on November 11, 2018. Revised on February 14, 2019.

INT:
	op will be the menu option the user chooses, which will determine whether he wants to convert to hexadecimal, octal, or exit the program.
LONG:
	num will be the number the user inputs, which will be displayed into either hexadecimal form or octal. This is taking int account very large numbers, and
	that's why num is a long. Since the program doesn't cooperate well when a negative number is entered, we will force the user to keep it positive :).
  
Program does not cooperate with negative values. Will prompt user to input another number.
